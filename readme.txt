#EphermalSpyChat

A terminal chat app using python that allows you to send and secret messages hidden safely inside an image. The chat app relies on the computer's non-persistent memory (RAM).
It uses external libraries - termcolor and steganography to print colored messages and to encrypt the data into an image.
To install, make sure you have python installed and type the following commands in your terminal:
$ pip install steganography
$ pip install termcolor
$ python SpyChatApplication.py
